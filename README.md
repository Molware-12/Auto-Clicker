# Auto-Clicker
Simple implementation of a autoclicker program written in python. I used the pyautogui, and pynput modules to implement the keyboard and mouse events, and used the time module for the intervals in the constructor. System module was only used to exit the entire program. I would appreciate if anyone could help me optimize the code or just add new features.
